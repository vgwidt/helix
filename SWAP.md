# Swap Files

I'm interested in implementing simple swap files for recovery.

Issues that would need to be addressed
- [ ] File preview uses Document::open, so it creates a swap file upon preview


Considerations:
- [ ] What file name should be used? 
- [ ] Should it try to detect Vim swap files?
- [ ]
